Given the following list of torch nn modules, generate a random torch model with a forward method that uses all of the modules in the list. You can use any number of views and reshapes as needed to accomadate the input and output shapes of the modules. Modules may be repeated up to 5 times.
Please include a comment at the top of the file that says "This is a random torch model generated by the following modules: {{modules}}"
Also assume that the input to the model is of any arbitrary shape.


Modules:
{{modules}}

An example output would be for the following modules: [Conv2d, max_pool2d, Linear, log_softmax, relu]

```python
# This is a random torch model generated by the following modules: [Conv2d, max_pool2d, Linear, log_softmax, relu]
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F


class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 10, kernel_size=5)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(10, 20, kernel_size=5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(320, 50)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(50, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(F.max_pool2d(self.conv1(x), 2))
        x = F.relu(F.max_pool2d(self.conv2(x), 2))
        x = x.view(-1, 320)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)


def get_random_inputs():
    # randomly generate input tensors based on the model architecture
    x = torch.randn(1, 1, 64, 64).cuda()
    return [x]

```
